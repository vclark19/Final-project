# Final-project EN.540.635
#### by Vincent Clark

## **Goal of the project**

The goal of this project was to develop a GUI to process protein database (PDB) files
and streamline the calculations for tasks including, calculating center of mass and radius of gyration,
determining the hydrophobicity of a protein, calculating all of the hydrogen bond partners, determining
the location of all secondary structures in the protein, etc.

## **Directions**
In order to correctly use the program please have the main.py file, text_setup.txt, calc.gif, and admin.txt saved to 
the working directory. Once downloaded, go to your bash terminal, navigate to your working, and enter the following.

```
$ python3 main.py
```

## **Interacting with the GUI**

Upon launching the program you will be prompted to either sign in or create an account.

After registering or signing in, you can enter the 4 character code for a PDB file of your choice and the program will fetch the file 
for you. Or you can upload your own PDB file, if it is already saved on your computer.

After choosing a file, please choose a taskk from the dropdown menu and click the calculate button.
